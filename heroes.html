            <h1>WHO ARE THE LEAGUE OF HEROES?</h1>
            <p>The League of Heroes is a band of Earth's mightiest costumed superheroes, who use their superpowers for good, fighting evil in all its forms.</p>
            <p>The League was founded in Toronto, Canada, by Dr. Goliath and his belief that he could make a better world, and that the law-abiding public deserve more.</p>
            <p>Since our debut on the world stage in 2015 we have established ourselves as the first and foremost superhero team.</p>

            <h2>HOW IT ALL BEGAN</h2>
            <p>In September 2014, Dr. Goliath left his position as a senior webmaster at Seneca College and dedicated himself to full time crime fighting.</p>
            <p>He gathered a team of people with the skills and temperament to make the venture a success.</p>
            <p>The League's first year was spent consolidating funding, acquiring expertise and equipment, as well as constructing the Fortress of Justice.</p>
